## Overview

This AR experience is designed to be displayed in museums, schools, or awareness campaigns. Users can rotate, zoom, and explore a 3D model of the dolphin and access basic information about its endangered status. Future expansions may include multiple animal exhibits, interactivity, and QR-code-triggered scenes.

## Features

- Simple, mobile-friendly HTML/CSS layout  
- Embedded `.glb` model with camera controls  
- Auto-rotation and AR mode enabled  
- Lightweight, no frameworks required  
- Fully deployable on [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
