## ⚙️ Important Notes

- All assets must use **relative paths** like:
  ```html
  src="./assets/models/dolphin.glb"
  ```
- No build tools are required (no npm, Parcel, Vite, etc).
- Works on any modern browser supporting `<model-viewer>`.
- Optional: for AR functionality on mobile, make sure your `.glb` model has AR-compatible metadata.

## 📚 Future Features (planned)

- Support for QR code scanning at exhibit locations.
- Interactive educational panels.
